Title: PizzaJointPDX

Description: A website where a user orders a pizza by
selecting the quantity, size, and toppings for the order.

Testing Setup:  Create the mocha and chai files, the spec-runner.js file.  Open
the spec-runner.js in the browser.

Testing:  Specs cover the creation of a new pizza object, the property
quantity, the property size, and the property topping.  These specs all
pass.  An additional spec to test the calculation of the pizza price does
not pass.  The live version of the application DOES calculate correctly.

Debugging:  I believe the application to this point is error free.  I used
alert, console.log, and debugger for debugging.

Future Improvements:
1) Allow for the selection of multiple toppings.
2) Flesh out the food menu and also include sides and drinks.
3) Apply company branding to the website.
